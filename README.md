## You can find a quick lecture on spatial and tabular queries for an Intro GIS class here

You can start the lecture by clicking [here](https://jethatch.github.io/spatialtabularqueries/#/)

**Please note, the map has been rendered as a static image in that slideshow to obviate the need for a web server.**
If you download (or clone) this repo and open queries.html in your browser, the map will be interactive.

This lecture also makes use of [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jethatch/geodemo), which will also be rendered statically in that link; however, there are directions in that repository on how to run it actively.

I hope you enjoy and any questions are always welcome.
